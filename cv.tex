\section{Experience}
\cventry{Sept 2013--Date}{Delivery Graduate}{BAE Systems Applied Intelligence}{London \& Guildford}{}{
Performed a variety of development and system design tasks across the porfolio
of the account I worked in during my previous internship. Created a prototype
for a large integration project with a large amount of ambiguity, effectively
reducing the technical risk of the project. Responsible for the design and
implementation for a subsystem of another SI project, working across two sides
liasing between the architecture team and the lead developer who had previously
owned the design.
%developer/designer core role, with all the other things around the outside
%
%things I did:
%a bit of BA work
%arch + design stuff
%delivering things (making the code)
%managing other people (a bit?)
%working across two sites liaising between split teams
%prototyping things, elaboration, design based on risk
}
\cventry{June 2012--Sept 2012}{Consultant}{BAE Systems Detica}{London}{}{
%need to tone this section down a bit as I make it sound as if I do more than I
%did
Worked within a small team of other interns delivering a system integration
project over the course of 10 weeks. 
I took responsibility for elaboration,
division of day to day work and acted as the technical authority for the team,
liaising with the architect responsible for the project.
}
\cventry{June 2011--Sept 2011}{Consultant}{Detica}{London}{}{
During a 10 week internship, I worked in a small team to implement a Java based
automated testing tool for web services. We successfully completed the tool to
time, delivering and presenting to managers at the end of the placement.
}
\cventry{June 2010--Sept 2010}{Junior Systems Engineer}{BAE Systems}{Christchurch Dorset}{}{
Returning to the same project as my previous employment, now having entered the
the customer testing and deployment phase. Responsibilities included
commissioning the software tools I had written as part of a hardware test
harness owned by the customer and requirements management involving verifying
signed off requirements with the aid of a software tool I developed specifically
for the task.
}
\cventry{Sept 2008--Oct 2009}{Test \& Integration Engineer}{BAE Systems}{Christchurch Dorset}{}{
Responsible for building and supporting the testing of a low-level high-speed
IP traffic generator and radio link emulator for a tactical network, gaining
experience in C and its use in and around the Linux kernel and its networking
subsystems. I was also responsible for writing design, deployment and maintenance
documentation for my work.
